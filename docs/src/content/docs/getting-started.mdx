## What is vibe?

vibe is a CLI tool that simplifies Git Worktree management. It helps you:

- Create worktrees for new features without leaving your main repository
- Automatically copy configuration files and dependencies
- Run setup hooks when creating or cleaning up worktrees
- Safely manage worktree lifecycle with interactive prompts

## Quick Start

### 1. Install vibe

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Homebrew">```bash brew install kexi/tap/vibe ```</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Deno">
    ```bash deno install -A --global jsr:@kexi/vibe ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Set up your shell

Add the following to your shell configuration:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Zsh">
    ```bash
    # Add to ~/.zshrc
    vibe() { eval "$(command vibe "$@")" }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bash">
    ```bash
    # Add to ~/.bashrc
    vibe() { eval "$(command vibe "$@")"; }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Fish">
    ```fish
    # Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    function vibe
        eval (command vibe $argv)
    end
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Create your first worktree

```bash
# Start working on a new feature
vibe start feat/my-new-feature

# Your terminal is now in the new worktree!
# Make your changes, commit, push, etc.

# When done, clean up the worktree
vibe clean
```

## Basic Workflow

```
main repository
     │
     ├── vibe start feat/feature-a  →  repo-feat-feature-a/
     │                                      │
     │                                      └── (work on feature)
     │
     └── vibe clean  ←─────────────────────────┘
           (returns to main, removes worktree)
```
