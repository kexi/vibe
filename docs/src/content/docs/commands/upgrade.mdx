## Use Cases

### Check for Updates in CI

Use the `--check` flag to check for updates without showing upgrade instructions:

```bash
$ vibe upgrade --check
vibe 0.7.0+abc1234

A new version is available: 0.8.0

Current: 0.7.0
Latest:  0.8.0
```

### Regular Update Check

Periodically check for updates to stay current:

```bash
vibe upgrade
```

## Network Requirements

This command requires network access to check the JSR registry for the latest version. Make sure `--allow-net` permission is enabled if you installed via Deno:

```bash
deno install --global --allow-run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env --allow-ffi --allow-net jsr:@kexi/vibe
```
