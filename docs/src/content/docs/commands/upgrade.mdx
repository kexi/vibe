The `upgrade` command checks for new versions and shows how to upgrade based on your installation method.

## Usage

```bash
vibe upgrade
```

## Options

### `--check`

Only check if a new version is available without showing upgrade instructions.

```bash
vibe upgrade --check
```

### `-V`, `--verbose`

Show detailed output including registry URL being checked.

```bash
vibe upgrade --verbose
```

### `-q`, `--quiet`

Suppress non-essential output. Only shows if an update is available.

```bash
vibe upgrade --quiet
```

## Behavior

### Version Check

The command fetches the latest version from the JSR registry and compares it with your current version:

```
$ vibe upgrade
vibe 0.8.0

A new version is available: 0.8.1

To upgrade:
  brew upgrade vibe

Release notes:

```

### Installation Method Detection
