The `clean` command removes the current worktree and returns you to the main repository.

## Usage

```bash
vibe clean
```

## Behavior

### Safety Checks

Before removing a worktree, `vibe clean`:

1. Checks for uncommitted changes
2. Prompts for confirmation if changes exist
3. Runs pre-clean hooks
4. Removes the worktree
5. Runs post-clean hooks
6. Changes directory to the main repository

### Uncommitted Changes Warning

```
$ vibe clean
You have uncommitted changes. Are you sure you want to clean? (y/N)
```

If you have uncommitted changes, vibe will:

- Show a warning
- Ask for confirmation
- Only proceed if you explicitly confirm

## Hooks

The `clean` command supports hooks for cleanup tasks:

```toml
[hooks]
pre_clean = ["git stash"]
post_clean = ["echo 'Cleanup complete'"]
```

| Hook         | When                    | Working Directory |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| `pre_clean`  | Before worktree removal | Current worktree  |
| `post_clean` | After worktree removal  | Main repository   |

### Pre-clean Hook Example

Save your work before cleaning:

```toml
[hooks]
pre_clean = [
  "git stash --include-untracked",
  "echo 'Changes stashed'"
]
```

### Post-clean Hook Example

Clean up shared resources:

```toml
[hooks]
post_clean = [
  "docker-compose down",
  "echo 'Cleanup complete'"
]
```

## Workflow

```
worktree (current)
     │
     ├── pre_clean hooks run
     │
     ├── git worktree remove
     │
     ├── post_clean hooks run
     │
     └── cd to main repository
            │
            ▼
main repository (new current)
```
