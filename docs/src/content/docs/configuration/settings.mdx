The `settings.json` file contains user-specific settings that are stored locally and not shared with your team. This file is located at `~/.config/vibe/settings.json`.

## Location

| Platform | Path                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| macOS    | `~/.config/vibe/settings.json` |
| Linux    | `~/.config/vibe/settings.json` |

## Configuration Options

### Fast Remove (Clean Performance)

By default, vibe uses a fast deletion strategy that moves the worktree directory to a temporary location and deletes it asynchronously in the background. This makes `vibe clean` feel instant even for large repositories.

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "clean": {
    "fast_remove": true
  }
}
```

| Option        | Default | Description                                        |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `fast_remove` | `true`  | Use fast async deletion (move + background delete) |

**How it works:**

1. Worktree directory is instantly renamed to a hidden `.vibe-trash-*` directory (O(1) operation)
2. Git worktree metadata is cleaned up against the now-empty directory
3. Actual file deletion happens asynchronously in the background
4. Previous `.vibe-trash-*` directories are automatically cleaned up

:::note
If fast rename fails for any reason, vibe automatically falls back to traditional deletion.
:::

### Worktree Path Script

Override the default worktree path with a custom script:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "worktree": {
    "path_script": "~/.config/vibe/worktree-path.sh"
  }
}
```

:::tip
This setting can also be configured per-repository in `.vibe.toml`. The user setting in `settings.json` takes precedence.
:::

### Skip Hash Check

Disable hash verification globally (not recommended):

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "skipHashCheck": true
}
```

:::caution
Disabling hash verification reduces security. Only use this if you understand the risks.

## JSON Schema

vibe provides a JSON Schema for editor autocompletion and validation. The `$schema` property is **automatically added** when vibe saves the settings file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kexi/vibe/v0.10.0/schemas/settings.schema.json",
  "version": 3,
  "clean": {
    "fast_remove": true
  }
}
```

The schema URL includes the vibe version tag (e.g., `v0.10.0`) to ensure compatibility with your installed version.

### VS Code Setup

VS Code automatically provides autocompletion when the `$schema` property is present. For manual configuration, add to your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["**/vibe/settings.json"],
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kexi/vibe/v0.10.0/schemas/settings.schema.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `v0.10.0` with your installed vibe version.

## Full Example

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kexi/vibe/v0.10.0/schemas/settings.schema.json",
  "version": 3,
  "skipHashCheck": false,
  "worktree": {
    "path_script": "~/.config/vibe/worktree-path.sh"
  },
  "clean": {
    "fast_remove": true
  },
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [],
    "deny": []
  }
}
```
