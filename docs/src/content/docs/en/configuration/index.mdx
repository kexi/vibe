vibe can be configured using TOML files to automate your workflow when creating and cleaning up worktrees.

## Configuration Files

| File               | Purpose                   | Git tracked     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| `.vibe.toml`       | Shared team configuration | Yes             |
| `.vibe.local.toml` | Personal local overrides  | No (gitignored) |

## Basic Example

Create a `.vibe.toml` file in your repository root:

```toml
# Copy files and directories from origin repository to worktree
[copy]
files = [".env"]
dirs = ["node_modules", ".cache"]

# Commands to run after worktree creation
[hooks]
pre_start = ["echo 'Preparing worktree...'"]
post_start = [
  "pnpm install",
  "pnpm db:migrate"
]
pre_clean = ["git stash"]
post_clean = ["echo 'Cleanup complete'"]
```

## First-time Setup

Before using configuration files, you need to trust them:

```bash
vibe trust
```

This registers the SHA-256 hash of your configuration files to prevent unauthorized modifications.
