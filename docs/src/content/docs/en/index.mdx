## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Simple Commands" icon="terminal">
    Just two main commands: `vibe start` to create a worktree, `vibe clean` to
    remove it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Idempotent Operations" icon="approve-check">
    Run `vibe start` multiple times safely - it handles existing worktrees
    gracefully.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automated Setup" icon="setting">
    Copy files, run hooks, and configure your environment automatically with
    `.vibe.toml`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security First" icon="warning">
    SHA-256 hash verification prevents unauthorized changes to configuration
    files.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
