The `trust` and `untrust` commands manage the trust status of configuration files.

## Usage

```bash
# Trust configuration files
vibe trust

# Untrust configuration files
vibe untrust
```

## Why Trust?

vibe uses SHA-256 hash verification to ensure configuration files haven't been tampered with. This prevents malicious scripts from running through hooks.

### Trust Flow

1. **First time**: Run `vibe trust` to register the hash of `.vibe.toml` and `.vibe.local.toml`
2. **Subsequent runs**: vibe verifies the hash before running any hooks
3. **File changes**: If the file changes, you'll need to re-run `vibe trust`

## vibe trust

Registers the current configuration files as trusted by storing their SHA-256 hashes.

```bash
$ vibe trust
Trusted .vibe.toml (hash: abc123...)
Trusted .vibe.local.toml (hash: def456...)
```

### What Gets Trusted

- `.vibe.toml` (if exists)
- `.vibe.local.toml` (if exists)

## vibe untrust

Removes trust for configuration files in the current repository.

```bash
$ vibe untrust
Untrusted .vibe.toml
Untrusted .vibe.local.toml
```

## Hash Verification

### When Hash Doesn't Match

If a configuration file has been modified since trusting:

```bash
$ vibe start feat/new-feature
Error: .vibe.toml hash mismatch.
The file has been modified since last trusted.
Run 'vibe trust' to re-trust the file.
```

### Multiple Hashes

vibe stores multiple hashes per file (up to 100), so you can switch between branches without re-trusting (as long as you've trusted each branch's version at least once).
