The `home` command navigates back to the main worktree without removing the current secondary worktree. This is useful when you need to temporarily check something in the main repository or switch to another worktree.

## Usage

```bash
vibe home
```

## Options

### `-V`, `--verbose`

Show detailed output including the main worktree path.

```bash
vibe home --verbose
```

### `-q`, `--quiet`

Suppress non-essential output.

```bash
vibe home --quiet
```

## Behavior

When run from a secondary worktree, `vibe home`:

1. Verifies you are inside a git repository
2. Checks if you are already in the main worktree
3. Navigates to the main worktree directory

When already in the main worktree, it shows an informational message and does nothing.

## Examples

```bash
# Navigate to main worktree from a secondary worktree
vibe home

# Already in main worktree
$ vibe home
Already in the main worktree.
```
