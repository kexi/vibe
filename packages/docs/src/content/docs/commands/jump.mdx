The `jump` command navigates to an existing Git Worktree by matching the branch name. It supports exact match, partial match, fuzzy match, and interactive selection.

## Usage

```bash
vibe jump <branch-name> [options]
```

## Options

| Option            | Description                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `-V`, `--verbose` | Show detailed output          |
| `-q`, `--quiet`   | Suppress non-essential output |

## Examples

```bash
# Jump to a worktree by exact branch name
vibe jump feat/new-feature

# Jump using partial match
vibe jump login

# Jump using fuzzy match (subsequence matching)
vibe jump feli   # matches "feat/login"

# Show detailed output
vibe jump feat/debug -V
```

## Behavior

### Search Order

`vibe jump` searches for worktrees in the following order:

1. **Exact match** (case-sensitive): If a worktree with the exact branch name exists, navigate to it immediately
2. **Exact match** (case-insensitive): If a worktree matches the branch name ignoring case, navigate to it
3. **Word boundary match** (case-sensitive, then case-insensitive): If the input appears at a word boundary (after `/`, `-`, or `_`), these matches are preferred over plain substring matches
4. **Substring match** (case-sensitive, then case-insensitive): If no word boundary match is found, fall back to substring matching. If multiple worktrees match, display an interactive selection prompt
5. **Fuzzy match** (subsequence matching): If no substring match is found and the search term is at least 3 characters, perform subsequence matching where each character of the search term appears in order within the branch name (e.g., `feli` matches `feat/login`). Results are ranked by a scoring algorithm that considers consecutive matches, word boundaries, and match position
6. **No match**: Offer to create a new worktree using `vibe start`

### Exact Match

```
$ vibe jump feat/new-feature
# → cd '/path/to/repo-feat-new-feature'
```

### Partial Match

```
$ vibe jump login
Matched: feat/login-page
# → cd '/path/to/repo-feat-login-page'
```

### Fuzzy Match

```
$ vibe jump feli
Matched: feat/login
# → cd '/path/to/repo-feat-login'
```

### Multiple Matches

```
$ vibe jump auth
Multiple worktrees match 'auth':
  1. feat/auth-login (/path/to/repo-feat-auth-login)
  2. feat/auth-logout (/path/to/repo-feat-auth-logout)
  3. Cancel
Please select (enter number):
```

### No Match (Fallback)

```
$ vibe jump feat/nonexistent
No worktree found for 'feat/nonexistent'. Create one with 'vibe start'? (Y/n)
```

If confirmed, `vibe start` is called to create the worktree.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Condition                                             |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Successful navigation, or user-initiated cancellation |
| `1`  | Error (empty branch name, git command failure)        |

User-initiated cancellation (selecting "Cancel" from the selection prompt or declining to create a new worktree) is treated as a successful exit, not an error.

## Limitations

- **Detached HEAD worktrees**: Worktrees in a detached HEAD state (not associated with a branch) are not included in the search. Only worktrees with a branch reference are searchable.
