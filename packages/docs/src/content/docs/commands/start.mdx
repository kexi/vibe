The `start` command creates a Git Worktree for the specified branch and changes to that directory.

## Usage

```bash
vibe start <branch> [options]
```

## Options

| Option            | Description                               |                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `--reuse`         | Use an existing branch (don't create new) |                          |
| `--base <ref>`    | Base branch/commit for new branch         |                          |
| `--no-hooks`      | Skip pre-start and post-start hooks       | <Badge text="v0.5.0+" /> |
| `--no-copy`       | Skip file and directory copying           | <Badge text="v0.5.0+" /> |
| `-n`, `--dry-run` | Preview operations without executing      | <Badge text="v0.8.0+" /> |
| `-V`, `--verbose` | Show detailed output                      | <Badge text="v0.8.0+" /> |
| `-q`, `--quiet`   | Suppress non-essential output             | <Badge text="v0.8.0+" /> |

Note: `--base` only applies when creating a new branch. If the branch already exists, it is ignored.

## Examples

```bash
# Create a worktree with a new branch
vibe start feat/new-feature

# Use an existing branch
vibe start feat/existing-branch

# Create a new branch from a base branch
vibe start feat/from-main --base main

# Quick start without hooks
vibe start feat/quick-fix --no-hooks

# Start without copying files
vibe start feat/clean-slate --no-copy

# Preview what would happen (short option)
vibe start feat/preview -n

# Show detailed output
vibe start feat/debug -V

# Suppress output
vibe start feat/silent -q
```

## Behavior

### Idempotent Operation

`vibe start` is idempotent - running it multiple times with the same branch is safe:

- If the worktree already exists with the same branch, vibe navigates to it
- No duplicate worktrees are created

### Interactive Prompts

`vibe start` handles various situations interactively:

#### Branch in use by another worktree

```
$ vibe start feat/new-feature
Branch 'feat/new-feature' is already in use by worktree '/path/to/repo-feat-new-feature'.
Navigate to the existing worktree? (Y/n)
```

#### Directory exists with different branch

You can choose from:

- **Overwrite**: Delete and recreate the worktree
- **Reuse**: Use the existing directory as-is
- **Cancel**: Abort the operation

### Worktree Location

By default, worktrees are created as siblings to the main repository:

```
/path/to/repo/           # Main repository
/path/to/repo-feat-new-feature/  # Worktree
```

## Workflow

When `vibe start` runs:

1. **Pre-start hooks** run in origin repository (if configured)
2. **Worktree creation**: Git worktree is created
3. **File copying**: Files/directories are copied (if configured)
4. **Post-start hooks** run in new worktree (if configured)
5. **Directory change**: Terminal switches to the new worktree
